  <p class="paragraph">The name is Anna Sylvester. Those close to me call me “Anners” or “Ners.” If you are reading this, we can officially be close. Perusing this site will give you a better idea of who I am and what I can do.

      I graduated from Furman University in May of 2018 with a BA in graphic design. I could talk about Gestalt Theory or fonts for hours and to some of my friends’ dismay, I have. After graduating, I entered into the world of digital marketing at an Atlanta start up. My favorite projects were working side-by-side with the company’s web developer. With the team encouraging me, I started to teach myself to code in my free time. Sometimes it just takes one person telling you, “you can do it.” In November of 2018, I went ahead and jumped head first into the world of coding by attending the Full-Stack Development Bootcamp at GA Tech. I graduate in May of 2019.

      The more interesting things about me include: I have a pet hedgehog named Guy. I am an expert at whistling. I am a ~sour~ craft beer connoisseur. And I tie dye in my spare time.
